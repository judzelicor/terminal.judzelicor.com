## Exposition

As a programmer, I am well-acquainted with the terminal. It is an integral tool to every programmer to navigate their local computers, perform tasks, and even control remote computers such as servers. It allows humans--programmers, to control their machine at a level beyond graphical user interfaces can. That is why I thought it would be interesting if I were to build my portfolio in a way to would seem like it was a terminal. This terminal portfolio currently relfects the aesthetic of my own terminal on my mac machine, and just your typical terminal, it allows one to navigate the many features on this website by typing in commands.

## Technology Stack

I thought about creating this portfolio using vanilla Javascript. However, I thought it would be more elegant to use React for the reason that I think it reflects the mechanism of a terminal. One enters a command and the result of the command is displayed on the screen. Perhaps in the future I will rebuild this entire website using vanilla Javascript but for the sake as well of speed of production, I decied that React would be the best choice. I also chose to write in the language of Typescript because I thought it would be a good opportunity to practice the language.

- HTML5 & CSS3
- React.js
- Typescript
- React Router
- Redux

## Moving Forward

I will continue to develop this website as my skills and portfolio grow sophisticated because at the end of the day, this is a portfolio website and it needs to showcase more of what I can do. Perhaps I could make things more efficient. The way I structured this website just came to be. I wasn't thinking of efficieny or elegance. I simply wrote it in a way that I thought was intuitive and logical at the time I was writing it. Thus, much is left to be desired.

## Features
✅ Ability to enter predefined commands: help, fetchsum, projects, experience, and clear. There are more commands to be implemented and other easter eggs that I'd like to add too.

✅ Visitors can traverse the history of commands by pressing the "up" and "down" arrow keys the way the a typical terminal functions.

✅ Responsive terminal section. 

❌ Ability to launch a simulated python or node environment. I think this would be a nice touch. I need to study up on this.

❌ Customizable themes.
